# Photographer Admin (standalone)

Minimal Next.js admin skeleton built from the provided Doccure admin HTML template.

How to run

1. cd admin-app
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The dev server runs on port 3001 by default. Open http://localhost:3001

Notes
- The page references theme images under `/Photographer/...` â€” keep those files in `public/Photographer/...` of the parent repository or copy them into `admin-app/public` if you want the images served locally.
- This is a minimal scaffold (no backend). I can add CRUD pages and API routes for managing services if you want.

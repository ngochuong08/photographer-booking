Drop your HTML/CSS/JS theme files here.

Guidelines:
- Keep an `index.html` or `theme.html` that contains the theme skeleton.
- Put CSS under `css/` and JS under `js/`.
- In `src/components/Layout.jsx` you can import or reference the theme classes.

Example: copy theme's `assets/` into this folder and include links from `index.html` to `/theme/css/style.css`.

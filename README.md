Photographer Booking â€” React scaffold

This repository contains a minimal Next.JS scaffold for a photographer booking platform. It's intentionally small so you can drop your existing HTML/CSS theme into `public/theme` and wire classes into components.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```
